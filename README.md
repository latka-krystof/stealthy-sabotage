# Stealthy Sabotage: Backdoor Attacks against Explainable Machine Learning

### Authors: Krystof Latka, James Shiffer, Steven Andrew Lewis, Mike Qu

This repo contains all source code used in our backdoor attack investigation, and serves for easier reproducibility. CIFAR-10 dataset can be loaded directly using Torch `datasets` library, while the NiH Chest X-Ray 14 dataset has to be imported and is not a part of this repo. However, the CSV file referenced in `NiH-Chest-Xray-Full-Disguise.ipynb` can be downloaded from the following Kaggle [link](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/khanfashee/nih-chest-x-ray-14-224x224-resized).
